Project Two, Words in Motion, Nicholas Lee

# project overview
I find community within the Chinese and Chinese American communtiy. Having grown up in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood, Chinatown was always a place my family frequented to. My grandparents immigrated to the U.S in the 1950's and Chinatown was the only safe space for them in San Francisco to find work and to build a livelihood. Finding inspiration from my cultural background, the words and animationc chosen for this project is a representation of resiliance and strength of chinese immigrants immigrating to the U.S.
