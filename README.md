# project overview
I find community within the Chinese and Chinese American communtiy. Having grown up in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood, Chinatown was always a place my family frequented. My grandparents immigrated to the U.S in the 1950's and Chinatown was the only safe space for them in San Francisco to find work and to build a livelihood. Finding inspiration from my cultural background, the lyrics and animation chosen for this project is a representation of resiliance and strength of chinese immigrants immigrating to the U.S. Many immigrants have lots of stories that they want to tell or either keep it a secret and to have a new start in a different country. For example my grandmother tells my sister and I many stories of when she was a young girl in China, my grandparent's process of immigration, and her life experience in the U.S. Another example includes the Angel Island immigration center and the poem inscriptions which documents what these immigrants experienced as it is a way to let people know and learn what they experienced. This song and this specific lyrics really stood out to me as stories are a way to tell people's life experiences and whether or not if those stories want to be told and leave it as a secret without letting anyone know.

Animations were used to create this dramatic effect of fading in and out of each line and word to tell a story of the lyrics and to emphasize their meaning. In the beginning there is a pulse effect to create a dramtic feel to signal the start of the animation. A dark background was used to resonate with the meaning of the lyrics and the lyrics were colored in a bright color to highlight them from the dark backbround. Words indicating the transition to the next page is in a different color because a hover effect would break the flow of the animations. Most of the animations consisted of fill mode of both backwards and forwards to keep the text not showing in the background and to keep the animation permanent. In addition, timing was considered in order to show each seperate line on each page so each page wasn't filled and overwhelmed with mutliple lines of text. Glow effects were also used such as the word "heart" on the second page to imitate the beating of the heart along with the transition to the next page.
